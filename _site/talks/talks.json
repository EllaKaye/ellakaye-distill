Benefits include reproducibility and keeping everything together and accessible. Also, it’s really easy to do, and to prove it, I will build a package from scratch before your very eyes. I will also introduce the bookdown package for writing reports and even your thesis. Filled with tips and tricks from my own experiences, this talk could save you hours!\nEvent details\nEvent: Birmingham R User Group\nDate: August 8th, 2018\nTime: 18:00-20:00 GMT+1\nLocation: Faraday Wharf, Innovation Birmingham Campus, Holt Street, Birmingham Science Park, B7 4BB\nSlides\nKeyboard Shortcuts for Slides:\nUse ← and → to navigate through the slides.\nUse f to toggle full screen.\nUse o to view an overview of all slides.\nUse h to see a list of other shortcuts.\n\n\n\nfitvids('.shareagain', {players: 'iframe'});\n\n\n\n\n",
