There's a little R function that I wrote and packaged up to generate a vector or data frame of words of a given length. I find it useful in a wide variety of contexts and thought other might too. To kick off my new blog, here's a post about it.

The function, `n_letter_words`, came about because I wanted to be able to generate row and column names for a large matrix - didn't matter what they were, as long as they were unique. Since I was in the habit of using the built-in `LETTERS` vector to do this for small matrices, I naturally thought of using combinations of letters to do this in a larger case. In figuring out how to do this, as is so often the case, it was [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11388359/unique-combination-of-all-elements-from-two-or-more-vectors) to the rescue. There, I learnt about `expand.grid` and could then use some tidyverse tools to get the vector I was after:

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
out <- expand.grid(LETTERS, LETTERS) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  unite(word, 1:2, sep = "") %>%
  pull()
c(head(out), tail(out))
```

Sorted! At least I thought so, until, a couple of months later, when I wanted to generate names for a 1000\*1000 matrix, and realised both that I'd forgotten the `expand.grid` trick, and once I'd re-found the stackoverflow post, that it didn't give me enough words. That was enough to make it worth writing a function, taking `n` as an argument, that gives all 'words' of length $n$. 

Writing functions always makes me think of what other arguments might be useful. What if we want something between the 676 two-letter words and 17,576 three-letter words (or the 456,976 four-letter words, etc)? Hence the argument `num_letters`, which can be set between 1 and 26, and results in a total of $\text{num_letters}^n$ words. By default, the function returns a `tibble`, but setting `as_vector = TRUE` does what you'd expect. And I threw in a `case` argument too.

Now that I had my function, what to do with it? I remembered articles I'd read about the usefulness of [making](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) and [sharing]((https://hilaryparker.com/2013/04/03/personal-r-packages/)) a personal package. Now seemed like the time to do that myself. 

So, [here](https://github.com/EllaKaye/EMK) is my personal package, `EMK`. If you think that `n_letter_words` might be of use to you, then feel free to install!

```{r message=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("EllaKaye/EMK")
```

Some examples of `n_letter_words`:

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(EMK)

n_letter_words(2)

some_three_letter_words <- n_letter_words(3, num_letters = 10, 
                                          case = "lower", 
                                          as_vector = TRUE)

c(head(some_three_letter_words), tail(some_three_letter_words))

length(some_three_letter_words)
```

For now, my personal package has only this one function, but watch this space! No doubt I'll be adding more that I find useful. Perhaps, you'll find them useful too.

Incidentally, none of the above would have happened if I'd just thought, for my test matrix `A`, to set `dimnames(A) <- list(1:nrow(A), 1:ncol(A))`!
