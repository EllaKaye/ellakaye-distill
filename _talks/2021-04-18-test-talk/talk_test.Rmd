Let's try some of John Helveston's icon link functions

```{r echo = FALSE}
source(here::here("R", "functions.R"))
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
icon_link(
    icon = "fab fa-github",
    text = "materials",
    url  = "https://github.com/EllaKaye/ellakaye-distill"
)

icon_link(
    icon = "fab fa-github",
    text = "more materials",
    url  = "https://github.com/EllaKaye/ellakaye-distill"
)
```
